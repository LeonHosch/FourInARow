## Rules

* Players take turns dropping own pieces into columns of a vertical grid.
* The goal is to connect four or more own pieces in a rowâ€”horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
* Thus the first player to achieve this wins the game.
* If the grid is filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
